`jq -r '.prices[][]'` - outputs json type of data to strings

`awk 'ORS=NR%2?" ":"\n"'` - formats strings into two columns

`awk '$1 >= epoch time && $1 <= epoch time { print $2 }'` - print lines only in range

`sort` - sort from the lowest to highest

`awk 'NR==1 { first = $0} END { print; print first }'` - print only the first and last values

`awk -v diff=0 '{diff=$1-$2} END { print diff }'` - print the difference between them
